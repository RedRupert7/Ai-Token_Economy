# AI-Assisted Token Economy Smart Contract

**Version:** 1.2  
**Description:**  
This smart contract establishes a token-driven economy that dynamically adapts to user behavior and market trends. Users can stake tokens, claim rewards, and benefit from a tiered reward system while market trends and a dynamic multiplier influence the token economy.

---

## Features
1. **Token Staking and Unstaking**  
   - Users can stake tokens to earn rewards based on their staking tier.  
   - Tokens can be unstaked at any time, reducing the user's stake.

2. **Reward System**  
   - Rewards are calculated based on the user's staking tier (`basic`, `silver`, `gold`) and a dynamic multiplier.  
   - Rewards are deducted from a predefined reward pool.

3. **Dynamic Multiplier**  
   - The contract owner can adjust the multiplier to influence reward distributions dynamically.

4. **Market Trends**  
   - Market trends can be logged with descriptions and impact factors to reflect real-world or simulated economic changes.

5. **User Data Management**  
   - User data such as stake amount, reward tier, and last activity block is tracked.

## Public Functions

### 1. **`stake-tokens (amount uint)`**
- Stake a specified amount of tokens.  
- Updates user data and reduces the total supply.

### 2. **`unstake-tokens (amount uint)`**
- Unstake a specified amount of tokens.  
- Updates user data and increases the total supply.

### 3. **`claim-rewards`**
- Claim rewards based on the user's stake, tier, and the dynamic multiplier.  
- Updates the reward pool and last activity block.

### 4. **`adjust-dynamic-multiplier (new-multiplier uint)`**
- Allows the contract owner to adjust the dynamic multiplier within valid bounds.

### 5. **`log-market-trend (trend-description string, impact-factor int)`**
- Log a new market trend with a description and an impact factor.  
- Adds a trend to the `market-trends` map and increments the trend ID.

## Read-Only Functions

### 1. **`get-user-info (user principal)`**
- Retrieves the staking and activity data for a user.

### 2. **`get-total-supply`**
- Returns the current total supply of tokens.

### 3. **`get-dynamic-multiplier`**
- Returns the current dynamic multiplier value.

### 4. **`get-market-trends`**
- Placeholder for retrieving market trends (map iteration not directly supported).

### 5. **`calculate-reward (user principal)`**
- Calculates the reward for a specified user based on their tier, stake, and the dynamic multiplier.

## Deployment Instructions
1. Deploy the contract using a compatible Stacks blockchain deployment tool.
2. Initialize the contract owner (`contract-owner`) to your wallet address.
3. Fund the reward pool (`reward-pool`) to enable rewards distribution.
4. Use the provided functions to manage the token economy.

---

## Usage Guidelines
- Ensure you maintain sufficient tokens in the reward pool to sustain the reward mechanism.
- Regularly monitor and adjust the dynamic multiplier and market trends to adapt the economy to user behavior and market conditions.
- Use read-only functions to audit user and contract data.
